I'm passionate about using data and technology to solve real-world business problems. Throughout my journey, I’ve been fortunate to work on projects that span multiple industries—each experience teaching me something new and helping me grow.

During my time as a Power BI Developer, I had the opportunity to work with clients in finance, logistics, and other fields, building customized dashboards that made data more accessible and decision-making more informed. It was exciting to see how data could directly impact business outcomes, and I enjoyed working closely with clients to make that happen.

As a Co-founder of Minics Digital, I dove into the world of digital marketing and client management. I worked with small businesses to craft personalized strategies that helped them build their online presence. Leading multiple teams and managing projects end-to-end was challenging, but watching these startups grow made it all worth it.

Right now, I’m eager to take on new opportunities where I can combine my data analytics skills with my passion for client-focused problem-solving. I’m always looking forward to the next challenge!
